# Lecture Notes - Merge Sort

Merge sort is a type of sorting algorithm. It will take in an array to sort and return the sorted array, In ascending order.

### Learning Objectives

- Complete a working, tested implementation of Merge Sort
- Be able to explain the performance compared to other sorting algorithms

### Lecture Flow

- Divide and conquer type of algorithm

  - First, divide the array into equal halves and then combine them in a sorted manner

- Performance
  - Useful for sorting linked lists in **O(n Log n)** time
  - This is worst case run time

### Algorithm

1. If the array has only 1 element, the array is considered sorted
2. Divide the list **recursively** into 2 halves until it can't be divided anymore
3. Merge the smaller lists into list in sorted order

### Pseudocode
